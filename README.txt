
This is a basic interpretation of the Super Mario Bros game. It generates a 2D grid representing a Mario stage, filled with coins, mushrooms, goombas, koopas, a warp pipe, and a boss. Mario navigates the stage in a direction chosen at random, engaging with whatever element he encounters within the array. He has the ability to gather coins, acquire power-ups, and vanquish foes. To progress to the subsequent stage and ultimately rescue the princess, Mario needs to either vanquish the boss or locate the warp pipe.
